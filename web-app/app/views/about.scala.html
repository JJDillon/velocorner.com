    <h1>Welcome to the cycling site!</h1>
    <div class="tag-box tag-box-v2 box-shadow shadow-effect-1">
        <p>
            The intent of the site is to provide some simple metrics for cycling
            (or other kind of sporting) activities, trail descriptions, biking videos.
        </p>
        <p>
            The metrics page compares yearly aggregated data, such as distance, hours ridden, elevation gained.
            The yearly data is also presented as a heatmap, so it is easy to compare the efforts for a given period of the year.
            Currently I'm using <a href="www.strava.com">Strava</a> and <a href="https://connect.garmin.com/">Garmin Connect</a>
            to track my activities, so the data feed is collected via the Strava API. Let me know if you are interested to see
            other kind of metrics useful to analyze the riding data.
